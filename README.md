This link will initiate the download of the Quicken installer.


## Step 2: Extract the Downloaded File


Once the download is complete, navigate to your Downloads folder or the location where you saved the installer. You may need to extract the files if they are zipped. Right-click the downloaded file and select "Extract All" to unpack the contents.


## Step 3: Run the Installer


After extracting the files, locate the `installer.exe` file within the extracted folder. Right-click this file and select "Run as administrator." This step is crucial, as it ensures that the installation process has the necessary permissions to write files and make changes to your system.


### Why Run as Administrator?


Running the installer with elevated privileges can prevent various installation errors that may arise due to permission issues. You want the process to be as smooth as possible, especially after investing your time in setting up Quicken on a new machine.


## Step 4: Follow the Installation Wizard


The Quicken installation wizard will guide you through the installation process. Follow these instructions:


1. Accept the End User License Agreement (EULA) when prompted.


2. Choose the installation type–usually, the default option is recommended for most users.


3. Select the location where you want to install Quicken (or simply use the default location).


4. Click "Install" and wait for the installation to complete.


## Step 5: Activate Quicken


After the installation finishes, you will be prompted to activate your Quicken. Enter your Quicken account details to complete the activation process.


This is an important step–without activation, some features may be limited, and you won’t have access to the full range of tools available for managing your finances.
